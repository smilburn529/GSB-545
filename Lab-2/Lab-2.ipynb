    "The Balanced RandomForestClassifier performed the best out of all the models I used. This model helps reduce the bias towards the majority class while maintaining good performance in predicting the minority class. All the other models had very low recalls, all under 10%, which means the model is missing most of the patients who actually have heart disease, which is critical in a healthcare setting. But in the Balanced RandomForestClassifier, the test metrics were much higher. It had a recall of 79% and a F1 score of 33%. This means that 79% of patients with a heart disease were correctly classified by this model."
