Other expenses like utilities I based it off what I spend now each month in Slo, and considering will have have roommates to split costs with. I estimate I will spend $300 on my car each month for insurance and gas. I would expect groceries to be around $400 a month because that's roughly what I spend now. I would expect to spend more money on Dining and Entertainment because I will be working full time I would expect to splurge more on things that I would like to spend my money on. And then I will include another $200 for miscellaneous costs that come up each month. I estimate that about 25% of my income will go to taxes in San Diego. This is a rough estimate based on a California Income Tax Calculator online. I predict it will be about 25% assuming my salary is between 65-100k. \n",
